###SWABATs

+ Site Planning - Think through and visualize the structure of their website
+ Wireframing - Create digital or hand drawn mockups of their site
+ Get started on projects

###Motivation
Do you think Michelangelo just walked into the Sistine Chapel and started slapping paint on the ceiling? No way! Careful planning goes into creating a masterpiece and you should think about final projects that same way.

###Lesson Plan
+ Before you start building your site think about your users and your site’s purpose.
+ All the elements you create should be serving that purpose and also making your as user friendly as possible.
+ You will probably want to have multiple pages. Think about creating a flowchart to make sure that your site is organized and that it is easy for your user’s to get where they need to go.
	+ Gliffy can be a helpful tool here.
+ Planning out how each page of your site will look is also important.
	+ Take a look at the site planning resources like Balsamiq that can help you create mockups.
+ Another important thing to think about is creating a responsive website.
+ You should think about how your pages will look like on both large and small screens and decide if you want to start out designing for desktops or follow a mobile first approach.
+ And now grasshopper you are ready to create. Go get ‘em!

<b>Design Principles - Color theory</b>

+ Color is a powerful form of communication. We are so attracted to color and so repelled by it that even if the coolest design were presented to us, if we didn't like the color, we wouldn't like it at all.
+ Studying how colors affect different people, either individually or as a group, is something some people build their careers on. And there’s a lot to it. Something as simple as changing the exact hue or saturation of a color can evoke a completely different feeling. Cultural differences mean that something that’s happy and uplifting in one country can be depressing in another.
+ The objective of this lesson is to help build color confidence. This means being able to create harmonious and effective color combinations in our designs. This can be done through practice and observation, awareness of trends, and understanding of color theory basics. Once we have that basic foundation, we can explore color and find inspiration everywhere in our world.
+ Warm Colors
	+ Warm colors include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colors. These are the colors of fire, of fall leaves, and of sunsets and sunrises, and are generally energizing, passionate, and positive.
	+ Red and yellow are both primary colors, with orange falling in the middle, which means warm colors are all truly warm and aren’t created by combining a warm color with a cool color. Use warm colors in your designs to reflect passion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy.
+ Cool Colors
	+ Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, are often more subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, of water, of nature, and are usually calming, relaxing, and somewhat reserved.
	+ Blue is the only primary color within the cool spectrum, which means the other colors are created by combining blue with a warm color (yellow for green and red for purple). Greens take on some of the attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red. Use cool colors in your designs to give a sense of calm or professionalism.
+ Neutrals
	+ Neutral colors often serve as the backdrop in design. They’re commonly combined with brighter accent colors. But they can also be used on their own in designs, and can create very sophisticated layouts. The meanings and impressions of neutral colors are much more affected by the colors that surround them than are warm and cool colors.
+ Color Terminology
	+ <b>Hue</b> is the most basic of color terms and basically denotes an object’s color. When we say “blue,” “green” or “red,” we’re talking about hue. The hues you use in your designs convey important messages to your website’s visitors. Read part 1 of this article for the meanings conveyed by various hues.
	+ <b>Chroma</b> refers to the purity of a color. A hue with high chroma has no black, white or gray in it. Adding white, black or gray reduces its chroma. It’s similar to saturation but not quite the same. Chroma can be thought of as the brightness of a color in comparison to white.
		+ Avoid using hues that have a very similar chroma. Opt instead for hues with chromas that are the same or a few steps away from each other.
	+ <b>Saturation</b> refers to how a hue appears under particular lighting conditions. Think of saturation in terms of weak vs. strong or pale vs. pure hues.
		+ Colors with similar saturation levels make for more cohesive-looking designs. As with chroma, colors with similar but not identical saturations can have a jarring effect on visitors.
	+ <b>Value</b> could also be called “lightness.” It refers to how light or dark a color is. Ligher colors have higher values. For example, orange has a higher value than navy blue or dark purple. Black has the lowest value of any hue, and white the highest.
		+ When applying color values to your designs, favor colors with different values, especially ones with high chroma. High contrast values generally result in more aesthetically pleasing designs.
	+ <b>Tones</b> are created when gray is added to a hue. Tones are generally duller or softer-looking than pure hues.
		+ Tones are sometimes easier to use in designs. Tones with more gray can lend a certain vintage feel to websites. Depending on the hues, they can also add a sophisticated or elegant look.
	+ <b>A shade</b> is created when black is added to a hue, making it darker. The word is often incorrectly used to describe tint or tone, but shade only applies to hues made darker by the addition of black.
		+ In design, very dark shades are sometimes used instead of black and can serve as neutrals. Combining shades with tints is best to avoid too dark and heavy a look.
+ Creating Your Own Color Palettes
	+ Color Wheel (for reference)
	<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory1.png">
	+ Monochromatic color schemes are made up of different tones, shades and tints within a specific hue. These are the simplest color schemes to create, as they’re all taken from the same hue, making it harder to create a jarring or ugly scheme (though both are still possible).
	+ Example
<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory2.png">
	+ The first color (if we look at this from left to right) would likely be used for headlines. The second color would be used for body text or possibly the background. The third color would likely be used for the background (or body text if color #2 was used as the background). And the last two colors would be used as accents or within graphics.
	+ <b>Analogous</b> color schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel. Generally, analogous color schemes all have the same chroma level, but by using tones, shades and tints we can add interest to these schemes and adapt them to our needs for designing websites.
	+ Examples:
	<img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory3.png">
	+ This is a traditional analogous color scheme, and while it’s visually appealing, there isn’t enough contrast between the colors for an effective website design.
	<img src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory4.png">
	+ Here’s a color scheme with the same hues as the one above, but with the chroma adjusted to give more variety. It’s now much more suitable for use in a website.
	+ <b>Complementary</b> schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel. In their most basic form, these schemes consist of only two colors, but can easily be expanded using tones, tints, and shades. A word of warning, though: using colors that are exact opposites with the same chroma and/or value right next to each other can be very jarring visually (they’ll appear to actually vibrate along their border in the most severe uses). This is best avoided (either by leaving white space between them or by adding another, transitional color between them).
	+ Example:
	<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory5.png">
	+ A wide range of tints, shades, and tones makes this a very versatile color scheme.
	<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/after-school-assets/colortheory6.png">
	+ Another complementary color scheme with a wide range of chromas.
+ You should choose only one of these strategies for your website and as a beginner it’s probably best to stick with 3 colors rather than five.
